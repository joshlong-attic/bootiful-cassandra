# Getting Started with DataStax Astra for Cassandra 

Specify a file path for   `cassandra.secure-connect-bundle` property. It should point to the secure connection bundle that you can download from the [astra.datastax.com](http://astra.datastax.com) portal in `Dashboard` -> `Databases` -> `<your keyspace>` -> `Connect`. Then, choose `Driver` and it'll let you `Download Secure Connect Bundle`.
